        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>As an experienced rural management professional with over two years of experience working for an NGO, my passion lies in empowering underprivileged communities through skills and livelihood training. I am currently seeking challenging job roles in the social sector that offer opportunities to leverage my expertise to create a positive impact. My extensive knowledge of rural contexts and communities, combined with my training in project management, risk management, make me an ideal candidate for organizations looking to make a significant impact in the social sector. I am deeply committed to effecting positive change in the lives of those in need and welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to a mission-driven organization.</p>
